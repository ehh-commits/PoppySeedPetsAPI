## Project Overview

Poppy Seed Pets is a browser-based pet adoption and activity simulation game (poppyseedpets.com). Monorepo with two independent apps:

- **`api/`** — Symfony 7.3 (PHP 8.4) backend with MySQL + Redis
- **`webapp/`** — Angular 20 frontend (TypeScript, SCSS, Angular Material)

**Path roots (avoid common mistake)**: `docs/`, `docs/tickets/`, `db/`, `proprietary-assets/` all live at the **repo root**. Code lives in `api/` or `webapp/`. If you `cd api` to run `composer`/`phpstan`, remember that Bash & PowerShell cwd persists across calls.

## Common Commands

- **API lint**: `composer run php-cs-fixer-dry-run` / `composer run php-cs-fixer` (in `api/`)
- **API static analysis**: `php vendor/bin/phpstan` (in `api/`)
- **Cron (manual)**: `php vendor/bin/crunz schedule:run` (in `api/`)
- **Storybook**: `ng run PoppySeedPetsApp:storybook` (in `webapp/`)

## Architecture Decisions & Patterns

* [docs/architecture/Departures from Symfony Standard.md](docs/architecture/Departures from Symfony Standard.md)
* [docs/architecture/Project Patterns.md](docs/architecture/Project Patterns.md)

We value:

* Null safety, data integrity, & exhaustiveness through defensive programming
* Creating ergonomic APIs with pits of success
* The principle of least surprise
* YAGNI & KISS

## Feature References

* [docs/features/merits.md](docs/features/merits.md) — every pet merit (trait), what it does, how it's acquired, and the conventions for each
* [docs/features/satyr-dice.md](docs/features/satyr-dice.md) — satyr dice mechanic

## Frontend Notes

- Dev server requires HTTPS — uses `dev.key`/`dev.pem` from repo root (expire Dec 2033)
- Proprietary assets expected at `proprietary-assets/` in the repo root (gitignored) — app builds without them but images will be missing
- API URL configured in `webapp/src/environments/environment.ts` (defaults to `https://localhost:8000`)

## Database

- Game data (recipes, items, NPCs) ships as `db/seed/*.sql`, auto-imported into MySQL on first `docker compose up`
